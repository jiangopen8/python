What is Helius?
Solana's Leading RPC&API Platform

Helius is an enterprise-grade Solana development platform offering best-in-class RPCs, APls,data streaming tools,and 24/7 customer support.Helius also runs the top Solana
validator and offers both individual stakers and institutional staking partners 0%fees and 100%MEV   rewards.



Solana RPCs 

To read data from and write data to Solana,applications require an RPC node.Our globally distributed fleet of RPCs are  powered  by  top-of-the-line  hardware,offer  99.99%uptime    SLAs,and are trusted by the largest wallets and applications on Solana.

We offer two types of RPC nodes:

1.  Shared RPC nodes-rate-limited  plans  ideal for  new projects that have moderate to high request loads
2.  Dedicated RPC nodes-ideal  for  large-scale  applications that  require  low  latencies with no rate limits

Our battle-tested nodes are globally distributed across  New York,Ashburn,Chicago,
Vancouver,Los Angeles,Singapore,Tokyo,Frankfurt,and the UK.For Shared RPC nodes, we automatically send your requests to the closest node,guaranteeing the quickest and   most  efficient  routing.


Staked Connections

Staked connections can improve transaction landing rates.As we run the largest validator on Solana,you can send transactions through our staked connections.

We offer two types of staked connections:

1.  Shared staked connections-available through  all of our paid standard  plans

2025/2/2701:22                                                                                               Helius Docs


2.  Dedicated  staked  connections-contact us to add on to any Helius plan

Dedicated staked connections are ideal for trading frms and enterprises requiring guaranteed bandwidth for sendTransaction   requests.Pricing is based on your   transactions per second(TPS).



Data Services

Get the Solana data you need,how you need it.Whether you're streaming real-time
updates or automating on-chain event handling,we've got you covered with tools built for speed,scale,and simplicity.


Data Streaming

We offer a variety of methods for streaming Solana data to your databases.

Geyser

Geyser is the fastest way to stream data.Using the Yellowstone Geyser plugin,you can subscribe to updates on blocks,slots,transactions,and accounts through our dedicated
RPC nodes.Ideal for low-latency use cases requiring real-time,high-throughput data access.

¢ Enhanced Websockets

We provide Enhanced Websocket methods for subscribing to transaction and account
updates.This feature is in beta and is only for business and professional plans.Suitable for non-latency critical real-time data needs in client-side applications.Not recommended for critical backend operations or applications requiring guaranteed message delivery.

¢ Standard Websockets

Websockets allow persistent,two-way communication between a client and a server,
enabling real-time data streams.Solana Websockets are available for Developer,Business, and Professional plans.Websockets are afragile connection type and can drop off

unexpectedly.Implement  a  robust  reconnection  logic  or  consider  using  Geyser  for  more reliable  data  streaming.


Event Notifications

¢ Webhooks

Webhooks  notify  you  of  onchain  events  in  real-time.With  support  for  over  70  transaction types ,you  can  automate  your  app's  interactions  with  Solana  without  complex  smart
contract  parsers.A  single  webhook  can  support  up  to   100,000  addresses.deal  for
automating  responses  to specific  on-chain events and  handling  large  address  sets.Not recommended  for  applications   requiring  sub-second   latency  or  those  with  frequently  changing address lists.


Solana APls 

Helius  offers  various  APls  for  interacting  with  NFTs,compressed  NFTs,and  tokens, calculating  priority  fees,and  parsing  transactions.


Priority Fee API

The Priority  Fee APl  enables you to  add  optional fees to your transactions to  incentivize
block  producers  (leaders)to  include  your  transaction  in  the  next  block.This  APl  is  useful  for improving  transaction   landing  rates,especially  during   periods  of  high   network  congestion.


Enhanced Transaction APls

The Enhanced  Transactions  APl provides  enriched,descriptive     context  for  Solana
transactions.Instead  of  opaque   bytes,you  get   human-readable   responses  for  transactions such  as  NFT  listings,DEX  swaps,DeFi  loans,DAO  votes,and  more.


Solana DASAPl and Compression

2025/2/2701:22                                                                                               Helius Docs


The Digital Asset Standard(DAS)is a unifed interface for Solana NFTs and tokens.Helius DASAPl  is Solana's most complete,and performant NFT and token API.The DASAPl also supports indexing and APl methods for interacting with compressed NFTs.


Photon APl and ZK Compression

ZK Compression  is ageneralized compression framework that allows developers to store  data on Solana at a fraction of the cost.Developers can use the Photon  APl  to easily access this compressed data.

2025/2/2701:22                                                                                               Helius Docs

Frequently Asked Questions


Iwant to switch between fiat and crypto payments.

Please contact our support team,and they will assist you with changing your payment method.


l paid for a plan,but it hasn't been updated yet in my dashboard.

It can take up to 1 hour for the system to update your plan.If it still doesn't update after that,reach out to our support team.

2025/2/2701:22                                                                                               Helius Docs



How do Icancel my subscription?

You can cancel by going to the Billing  page and clicking the Cancel Subscription button.


What does"Authorize Automatic Withdrawals"mean?

When you authorize automatic withdrawals,you're giving the platform permission to pull     the necessary amount of USDC(on Solana)directly from your wallet whenever a new billing period  starts.This  is  often  referred  to  as  a"subscription"or＾recurring  payment,"where  you  don't have to manually approve each individual charge.

¢ How It Works:
o At the beginning of each billing cycle,the system checks if you have enough USDC in your Solana wallet.
o  If sufficient funds are available,the required amount is automatically deducted to cover the plan's cost.
o If you ever want to stop automatic charges,you can revoke this authorization via your wallet or billing settings.
Why Authorize?
o It saves you from having to manually make a payment every month(or billing period).
。It ensures your service continues without interruption,as the payment is handled automatically.
¢ Things to Keep in Mind:
。 Suffcient Funds:Make sure your wallet has enough USDC ahead of each billing date.
。 Revoking Authorization:You can usually disable or revoke this automatic withdrawal at any time if you decide you'd rather pay manually.


How can lmanually pay for my subscription instead of authorizing payments?

2025/2/2701:22                                                                                          Helius Docs


Manual payments are not supported.You must authorize USDCso it can be automatically deducted on billing days.However,you can revoke this authorization after each purchase by following these steps:

1.Go to the Billing page and click Manage Delegate Wallet(this willredirect you to Loop). 2.Select your  plan(e.g.,Developer).
3.Click Edit in the Authorization section.     4.Set the limit to O to revoke authorization.

How to Order a Dedicated Node

Dedicated Nodes can be ordered directly from the developer  portal on the  Dedicated Nodes  tab.
　　　　
Order a dedicated node from your Helius dashboard


Node Type

The type of node you choose depends on your specifc project requirements.Reviewing
each node's CPU cores and RAM is important to determine which will best support your     workload.Since we don't impose any rate limits,your node's performance will rely entirely on its specifications.



If you plan to make resource-intensive calls(e.g., getProgramAccounts,
getTokenLargestAccounts                         ,getTokenAccountsByDelegate ,
		getTokenAccountsByOwner,getLargestAccounts                     ),the      AMD      EPYC7543pand  AMD EPYC9254 offer similar performance,but the EPYC9254is newer and more efficient.

The AMD EPYC7443p is better if your workload does not require resource-intensive calls.

Getting Started with Dedicated Nodes
Dedicated Nodes with Increased Bandwidth and Reduced Latency



Dashboard Overview

Once you have placed an order for a Dedicated Node you will get access to the overview
page which will be your Dedicated Node Hub.This will have all your pending orders and
active Nodes.It can be reached by going to the Dedicated Nodes tab on the main dashboard or by clicking here. You will get an email once your node is ready and the status will change
to Succeeded.

　　　　
Dedicated Nodes Dashboard


Order ID and Host ID

Order ID and Host ID are identifers that can be used when contacting the support team with questions regarding your order(Order  ID)or your node(Host  ID).Think of them as names for your Node.


URL

The URLis your standard Solana RPC URL which can be used to call RPC methods or used as a websocket by changing https to wss.


gRPC URL&gRPC Token

2025/2/2701:22                                                                                               Helius Docs


Your gRPC URLand gRPC Token are used when working with the Geyser Plugin that you chose.There will be code examples further that will explain how to use the gRPC and
stream Solana events with minimal latency.All our dedicated nodes are Shredstream enhanced.


Region

This is where your node is located



Solana version

This is the current version that is running on your node.


Geyser type

This is the Geyser plugin you chose.



Status

Status represents the current state of your node:

，Pending-signifies  a  pending  order  for  your   node ，   Underway-   your node is being set up
，   Succeeded-  your node is fully set up ，   Failed-   your node is down


Node  Deactivated

This indicates if your node is currently suspended.If a payment is missed,your node will be  deactivated automatically.You have a 3-day grace period to reactivate it by completing the payment.

2025/2/2701:22                                                                                               Helius Docs




Action Buttons

There are also 4 action buttons on the right that give you fullcontrol over your node's lifecycle and  performance  monitoring.


1   Update Version

，Lets you update or downgrade your node's version     ，Use this when you want to update to a newer version
，Important to  keep your  node  up-to-date  with  latest features  and  performance  updates



Metrics

，Shows  your  node's  performance
，Track things like your response times,requests per second,success and failure rates ，Monitor health and usage with request success rates and error rates


 Delete Node

，Permanently and immediately removes your node and cancels the subscription
¢ This cannot be undone and you will have to order a new Node



Working With Your Node


RPC and Websocket

Each dedicated eode comes with an RPC URL that you can use like in the example below. Here we are using Solana web3.js to call getSlot     using our dedicated  node:

2025/2/2701:22                                                                             Helius Docs


　　　　

This is how you would set up a native websocket connection to stream new slots:

Best Practices


Managing Node Load

While nodes don't have strict usage limits,they are bound by hardware constraints.A balanced   workload    helps    maintain    optimal    performance    and    node    liveliness.

2025/2/2701:22                                                                                               Helius Docs


¢ Avoid mixing heavy account-basedcalls(e.g. getProgramAccounts,
getTokenAccountsByOwner,  etc.)with gRPC usage on the same node.
。 It's best to move heavy account-based calls to a shared plan since we have a custom indexer  that makes those calls much faster.
¢ Monitor your node's metrics to understand its performance based on response times, successful request %,and error counts.
，Consider  distributing  intensive  workloads  across  multiple  nodes  ina  dedicated  fleet

　　　　


System Recovery

Our nodes include an automatic recovery mechanism:

，Ifa  node falls too far  behind  in  processing  slots,it will automatically  initiate a  restart
¢ During this recovery period,all requests are seamlessly routed to our shared backup pool
，Once your node catches up and becomes healthy,traffc will resume to it

HTTP
Solana nodes accept HTTP requests using the JSON-RPC2.0 specification.


Info

，For  JavaScript  applications,use  the   @solana/web3.js    library as a convenient interface for the RPC methods to interact with a Solana node.
，For a PubSub connection to a Solana node,use the WebSocket API.




Request Formatting

To make a JSON-RPC request,send an HTTP POST request with a     Content-Type:
application/json        header.The JSON  request data should contain the following felds:

Field                         Type                          Description
jsonrpc	string	Set to "2.0".


id			A unique identifier for the request,generated by the
client.Can be a string,number or null.
	string |number		
		

method	
string	The name of the method to invoke.

params	
array	AJSON array of ordered parameter values.

　　　　


Example Request using cURL

2025/2/2701:22                                                                                               Helius Docs


　　　　


Response      Format

The response willbe a JSON object with the following fields:

Field                          Type                            Description

jsonrpc	
string	Matches the request specification
id	number	Matches the request identifier.

result	array|number|object|stri ng	Requested data or success confirmation.




Batch Requests

Requests can be sent in batches by sending an array of JSON-RPC request objects in a single POST request.

　　　　


Example Request with Commitment

The  commitment  parameter should be included as the last element in the  params  array:

2025/2/2701:22                                                                                               Helius Docs



　　　　



Definitions

，Hash:ASHA-256  hash  of  a  chunk  of  data.
¢ Pubkey: The public key of an Ed25519 key-pair.
¢ Transaction:A list of Solana instructions signed by a client keypair to authorize those actions.
，   Signature:An  Ed25519 signature of a transaction's  payload data,including instructions.This can be used to identify transactions.


Health Check

Although not part of the JSON-RPCAPI,a  GET  /health  request at the RPCHTTP
endpoint provides a health-check mechanism for load balancers or other network infrastructure.

Websocket
Stream data directly to your applications with our websocket integration.

Websockets allow for two-way communication between a client and a server.Unlike   traditional request-response models,Websockets keep a persistent connection open, enabling real-time data exchange.This is perfect for applications that require instant   updates,such as chat apps,online games and marketplaces.



Standard Websockets

Helius   supports   allstable   Solana   Websockets. You can  use these with your  Helius  WSS  URL:
¢ Mainnet-    wss://mainnet.helius-rpc.com
，   Devnet- [wss://devnet.helius-rpc.com

　　　　

After connecting to the websocket:

，Submit subscription requests to the websocket using the methods. ，Multiple subscriptions may be active at once.
¢ Many subscriptions take the optional  commitment  parameter,defining how finalized a change should be to trigger anotification.For subscriptions,if commitment is
unspecified,the default value is      finalized .

Geyser(Yellowstone)
Highly configurable real-time data streams.



What are gRPC streams?

Geyser orgRPC streams provide the fastest and most efficient way to stream Solana data  directly to your backend.With gRPC,you can subscribe to blocks,slots,transactions,and   account updates.It is highly configurable.You can filter or limit each subscription.It allows the client-server to create new subscriptions or cancel existing ones immediately.

To learn more,please read the examples provided in the source  repo.

　　　　



Subscribe Request

In  the  subscribe  request,you  need  to  include  the  following:

　commitment  :Specifies  the  commitment  level,which  can  be  processed,confirmed,or finalized.

accounts_data_slice:An                 array                 of                 objects   {  o  f  f  s  e  t  :  u  i  n  t  6  4  ,  l  e  n  g  t  h  :  u  i  n  t  6  4徨
that allows you to receive only the required data slices from accounts.

	ping :An optional boolean.Some cloud providers(e.g.,Cloudflare)close idle streams.To keep the connection alive,set this to true.The server willrespond with a Pong message    every 15 seconds,avoiding the need to resend flters.

Next,you'll  need to  specify the flters for the data you want to subscribe to,such  as accounts,blocks,slots,or       transactions.

2025/2/2701:22                                                                                               Helius Docs




〔  Slots
filter   by    commitment     -By default,slots  are sent for all  commitment  levels.
With this flter,you can choose to receive only the selected commitment level.



〔Accounts
account   :Matches any  public key from the provided array.
　owner  :The account owner's public key.Matches any public key from the provided  array.
　filters       :Similar to the filters  in getProgramAccounts.  This is an array of 	dataSize    and/or  Memcmp filters.Supported   encoding   includes   bytes ,   	base58 ,and     base64.
If all fields are empty,allaccounts are  broadcasted.Otherwise:
¢ Fields operate as a logical AND.
，Values within arrays act as a  logical OR(except within filters,which operate as a logical AND)


〔Transaction

vote  :Enable or disable the  broadcast of vote transactions.
failed     :Enable or disable the broadcast of failed transactions.
signature    :Broadcast only transactions  matching the specified signature.
　account       include:Filter transactions that  involve any account from the provided  list.
　account     exclude:Exclude transactions that  involve  any  account from the provided  list(opposite  of  account      include ).
		account   required    :Filter  transactions  that  involve all accounts from the provided list(all accounts must be used).

If all felds are left empty,all transactions are broadcasted.Otherwise: ，Fields operate as a logical AND.
，Values within arrays are treated as a logical OR.


　　　　

　　　　


〔  Entries
Currently,there are no filters available for entries;all entries are broadcasted.

Getting Started with Yellowstone gRPC(Geyser Plugin)
A comprehensive setup guide for connecting to Solana's real-time data stream using Yellowstone gRPC.



Introduction

With Dedicated Node,you can leverage the powerful Yellowstone gRPCinterface to receive real-time updates about on-chain events.The Geyser plugin provides a high- performance,low-latency stream of Solana blockchain data.



What isgRPCand Why Use It?

gRPC(Google  Remote  Procedure Call)is a modern,high-performance framework that
enables client and server applications to communicate transparently.For Solana blockchain data streaming,gRPC offers several key advantages:

1.  Language Agnostic:Using  Protocol  Buffers(protobuf),gRPC  allows  you to write  clients in multiple programming languages while maintaining type safety and consistency.
2.  Binary Protocol:Unlike JSON-based REST APls,gRPC uses a binary protocol that is more efficient in terms of bandwidth and parsing overhead.
3.  Bi-directional Streaming:gRPC  supports  bi-directional  streaming,perfect  for  receiving continuous updates about blockchain events.
4. Type Safety:The protobufschema ensures type safety across all supported languages.



Getting Started

Your Helius Dedicated Node exposes the Yellowstone gRPCinterface on port 2053.The service provides various subscription options for different types of blockchain data:

¢  Account  updates

These setups provide the foundation for the examples in the following sections.Each subsequent guide willbuild upon this basic setup to demonstrate specific monitoring capabilities.



Available Subscriptions

The Yellowstone gRPCinterface allows you to subscribe to various types of data:


1.Account Updates

Subscribe to changes in account data,including:

，Account  balance  changes ¢  Data  modifcations
，Ownership    changes
，Creation/deletion     events


2.Slot Updates




Monitor slots to  receive  notifications  about:

¢  New  slots
，Confirmed      slots
¢  Finalized  slots
，Parent   slot   relationships


3.Transaction Information

Stream transactions to receive updates about:

¢  Transaction  signatures
¢  Transaction  status
，Success/failure       information
¢  Account  involvement


4.Block Data

Access comprehensive block   information:

¢  Block  metadata
¢  Included  transactions ，Account      updates
¢   Entry   information


5.Entry Data

Track low-level  entry  information:

¢  Entry  indexes
¢  Transaction  counts
¢  Entry  hashes

2025/2/2701:22                                                                                               Helius Docs




Commitment Levels

Yellowstone gRPC supports three commitment levels:

¢[ PROCESSED :Fastest,but may include unconfrmed data
¢   CONFIRMED  :Balance      between      speed      and      finality
¢  FINALIZED :Highest level of finality

Choose the appropriate commitment level based on your application's requirements for data finality versus latency.


Next Steps

Continue to the following sections to learn about the core subscription types in Yellowstone gRPC:

1.Account  Monitoring-Monitor account  updates and changes
2.Transaction Monitoring-Track transactions and their status
3.Slot  and  Block  Monitoring-Monitor  slots,blocks,and  their  metadata 4.Entry Monitoring-Track low-level block entries and execution

Each guide includes complete working examples in TypeScript,Rust,and Go,along with advanced filtering patterns and best practices.

Enhanced Websockets(beta)
Stream real-time transaction and account updates directly to your applications with our enhanced    websocket     integration.



What are Enhanced Websockets?

Helius   provides   Geyser-enhanced  WebSockets   in  addition  to   Solana's  standard  WebSocket methods.These   enhanced  WebSockets   offer  faster   response   times   than   traditional   RPC
WebSockets.We support two key subscription methods: transactionSubscribe      and 	accountSubscribe .

　　　　

　　　　

2025/2/2701:22                                                                                 Helius Docs




Subscription Endpoints

Geyser-enhanced websockets are currently available on  mainnet  and   devnet  with  the following URLs

Mainnet: wss://atlas-mainnet.helius-rpc.com/?api-key=<API           KEY>

Devnet: wss://atlas-devnet.helius-rpc.com/?api-key=<API            KEY>

　　　　



Transaction Subscribe

The transactionSubscribe websocket method enables real-time transaction events.To use
　it,provide  a     TransactionSubscribeFilter     and optionally include 	TransactionSubscribeOptions     for further customization.


TransactionSubscribeFilter

	vote :Aboolean flag to include/exclude vote-related transactions.

	failed    :Aboolean flag to include/exclude transactions that failed.

signature   :Filters updates to a specific transaction based on its signature.

accountInclude   :A list of accounts for which you want to receive transaction updates.
This means that only one of the accounts must be included in the transaction updates(e.g., Account 1OR Account 2).

accountExclude      :A   list  of  accounts  you  want  to   exclude  from  transaction   updates.

2025/2/2701:22                                                                             Helius Docs


　accountRequired:   Transactions must involve these specified accounts to be included in updates.This means that allof the accounts must be included in the transaction updates   (e.g.,Account 1AND Account 2).

　　　　


TransactionSubscribeOptions(Optional)

　commitment :Specifies the commitment level for fetching data,dictating at what stage of the transaction lifecycle updates are sent.The possible values are processed,confirmed    and finalized

encoding  :Sets  the  encoding  format  of  the  returned  transaction  data.The  possible  values
are base58,base64 and jsonParsed

　transactionDetails|      :Determines the level of detail for the returned transaction data. The possible values are full,signatures,accounts and none

　showRewards :A  boolean flag  indicating  if reward data should  be  included  in  the transaction    updates.

　maxSupportedTransactionVersion         :Specifies  the  highest  version  of transactions  you want to  receive  updates.To  get Versioned  Transactions,set the value to  1.

〔Code    Example

In this example,we are subscribing to transactions that contain the Raydium account                 675kPX9MHTjS2zt1qfr1NYHuzeLXfQM9H24wFSUt1Mp8 .
Whenever a transaction occurs that contains
　675kPX9MHTjS2zt1qfr1NYHuzeLXfQM9H24wFSUt1Mp8  in  the  accountKeys   of the transaction,we will receive a websocket notification.
Based on the subscription options,the transaction notification will be sent at  the   processed  commitment   level, jsonParsed  encoding,   full      transaction details,and will show rewards.

Account Subscribe

Solana's  Websockets  supports  a  method  that  allows  you  to  subscribe  to  an  account  and
receive notifications via the websocket connection whenever there are changes to the
lamports  or  data  associated  with  amatching  account  public  key.This  method  aligns  directly with the Solana Websocket APl specification.



Parameters

string   :The account public key,sent in base58 format(required). object  :An optional object used to pass additional parameters.
¢ [encoding :Specifies the format for data returned in the AccountNotification.
Supported values:base58,base64,base64+zstd,jsonParsed(default is base58).
¢ commitment   :Defines   the    commitment   level    for   the    transaction.Supported    values: finalized,confirmed,processed(default is finalized).

We will see an update whenever a change occurs to the account data or the lamports for this account.
This happens at a frequent interval for this specific account as the   slot    and
unixTimestamp    are both a part of the returned account data.

Webhooks
Setup powerful event-driven workflows in seconds.

Helius  Webhooks   enable  seamless  monitoring  of  Solana   on-chain  events,such  as  sales,    listings,swaps,and    more.We    offer    a    user-friendly    interface,programmatic    API,and    SDK access  for  easily  creating  and  managing  webhooks.

For a detailed list of supported events,please refer to our documentation.

　　　　



Types of Webhooks

We currently offer several types of webhooks tailored to different needs:

，   Enhanced Transaction Webhooks:Provide human-readable,parsed data for specific transaction types(e.g.,NFT sales)related to the addresses you monitor.This is ideal if you want filtered,actionable insights.
¢ Raw Transaction Webhooks:This option delivers raw transaction data for all  transactions involving the addresses you monitor.It does not allow filtering by transaction type.
¢ Discord Webhooks:Stream updates for specific transaction types directly to a
designated  Discord  channel  as  formatted  messages.To  use  this  option,you  must  submit your   Discord   Webhook   URL.

Quick  Start

We  provide  three  convenient  methods  to  create,edit,and  manage  webhooks  on  Helius.



Via Helius Dashboard

The  Helius  Ulis  perfect  if  you  prefer  a  no-code  solution  with  additional  features  like
viewing logs and sending test webhook events.You can access it directly through our
Dashboard .You can add up to 25 addresses via the Dashboard.To monitor more than 25 addresses,you can use our APl or SDK.

2025/2/2701:22                                                                                                    Helius Docs

Configuring a Webhook



Via Helius API

If  you're  not  working  with  Typescript  or  Javascript,you'll  need  to  interact  with  our webhooks through  REST API:

 API  Reference                                                                                                                >

2025/2/2701:22                                                                                               Helius Docs




Via Helius SDK

The easiest-and most enjoyable-way to interact with Helius webhooks is through our official SDKs.We currently offer SDKs for TypeScript and Rust.

GitHub-helius-labs/helius-sdk
>
GitHub

GitHub-helius-labs/helius-rust-sdk:Asynchronous Helius Rust SDK
GitHub	
>

The SDKs provide powerful abstractions that enhance the functionality of webhooks,
including the ability to create collection webhooks that effortlessly track all NFTs within a specifc NFT collection!



Example Uses

¢ Bots
o When an NFT is listed on marketplace X,trigger an "NFT buy"action.
o When amargin position is unhealthy,trigger a "liquidation"action.
Monitoring&Alerts
o When a program emits a certain log,it triggers PagerDuty integration.
o When a token account balance changes by more than X%,use Dialect to communicate a warning action.
Event-driven Indexing
。When any transaction occurs for agiven program,send it directly to your database or backend.
Notifications &Activity Tracking
。When transferring from walletXto walletY-send a Slack  notification or email.
Analytics&Logs

Have a question about Helius webhooks?


What is the retry policy for webhooks?

Currently,we resend unacknowledged webhook events once per minute for three minutes. We also offer customizable retry policies for enterprise plans.


When does the Webhook send a notification?

Webhooks notify as soon as a transaction is confirmed.



What is the difference between"raw"and "enhanced" webhooks?
Raw webhooks are regular Solana transactions.When a transaction occurs for the given  addresses in a raw webhook,those transactions willbe directly sent to the webhook URL supplied by the user.

Enhanced webhooks are for Helius'interpreted transaction types.We parse over 100 types of Solana transactions,including  NFT  listings,DeFi  swaps,Solana transfers,etc.,and
abstract these into our own schema.If you want to listen for any transaction and don't want Helius abstractions,use  raw webhooks.If you want  built-in transaction type  detection,use
enhanced webhooks.


Are webhooks available on Devnet?

Yes!


How many addresses can linput for 1 webhook?

2025/2/2701:22                                                                                               Helius Docs


Up to 100,000 addresses.


How can l verify that the webhook came from Helius?

You can specify an authorization  header when creating(or updating)awebhook.Helius will include set the value in the    Authorization     header when sending data to your webhook.


Can linput"localhost"for my webhook URL?

No!This is a very common mistake.We can not detect your own local servers from just "localhost."


Can Imonitor an entire NFT collection?

Yes,you can!See the Helius SDK for a code example.


Do webhooks post failed transactions?

It depends on the type.Enhanced webhooks do not,but raw webhooks do!
